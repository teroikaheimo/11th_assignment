Mobile Programming Assignment #11 Permissions, Contacts Intent

Make an application which has a list and a two buttons. 
Pressing the other button opens the Android's contact selection screen. 
If you don't have any contacts in your emulated or real device, make a few dummy contacts. 
Pressing the other button clears the list.

If you selected a contact, the name of the contact is added to the list. 
List cannot have same contact twice. A list row has a checkbox in it, so that you can select 1-n selected contacts.
